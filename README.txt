Articles - Newsflash Enhanced

This extensions is an enhanced version of Joomla's default module - Articles - Newsflash (mod_articles_news).

Besides all the features of Articles - Newsflash module - this module allows you to add X number of Links/Titles i.e. now you have the power to display X number of articles with intro text (default feature) and X number of articles without intro text (enhanced feature). So essentially this Enhanced Newsflash Module will display a fixed number of articles from a specific category & fixed number of links/titles.

Limitation: This new feature will work only when we have set "Show Article title" to yes. As the name suggests - without enabling this parameter - the new feature has no relevance.
